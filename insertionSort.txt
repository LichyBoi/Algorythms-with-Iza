def insertionSort(alist): --> parameter is a unsorted array
    for i in range(1, len(alist)): --> itterates through range [1,lengh of array)
        tmp = alist[i] --> temporary variable is set equal to item with index i in the array
        k = i --> k is equal to i
        while k > 0 and tmp < alist[k - 1]: --> while k is greater than 0 and tmp is less than the item behind it
            alist[k] = alist[k - 1] --> make item with index k equal to the number with index k-1
            k -= 1 --> reduce k by 1
            alist[k] = tmp --> make index k of the array have an item eqaul to temp
    return alist --> return srted list

you start with the secon number in the array and comapre it with the first
if the second number is less than the first number swap their postitions
then you move on to the third number
if the third number is less than the second, swap
if the third number(now second) is less than the first, swap
continue until sorted

General Logic:
Compare a number with the number below it if its smaller swap

    but idk what else to add and how to explain
